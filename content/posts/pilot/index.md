> *We just decided to -- Charlie, The Newsroom, TV Series 2012-2014*

Well, *Charlie* was telling his friend, *Will*, that in the old days
they did the news well; how? They just decided to.

However, I'm not going to do any news, nor I will try to teach anything
to anybody. I'm really new to this.
This blog is my attempt to self reflect on the things I'm
learning throughout my development in software engineering. That does not
mean I'm going to just be talking about tech. I will try to bring other
aspects of my life as well.

*Note to self:*

I will try my best and jot down blog posts of thoughts and experiments
in the tech world.

*As I'm writing, I'm thinking of how this whole [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) 
project is going to be distributed in some corner of the web.*

I guess if you ever have the change to read this very blog, means that
I've done this successfully! :relieved:
