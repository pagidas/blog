# About

#### Hello, world!

My name is Kostas Akrivos; I'm a Software Engineer from Thessaloniki, Greece;
currently based in London, UK.

I'm passionate about technology, and always curious about new tools that 
help you build a piece of software. I attended a ***BSc Computer Science***
in ***University of Bangor, Wales*** which I didn't finish in the end. I had
other things in mind that time; things I still hold on to in order to keep
my creativity juices up. After some time, trying to learn about the world,
doing different things -- work, hobbies -- I decided to catch up on software
development once again. Ideas of small apps never left my mind unoccupied.
So I started a ***Full-Stack Software Developer Coding Bootcamp*** in
Athens, Greece, which made me thinking even more about software development.
And up to this point, I still work professionally as a Software Engineer in
London, UK.

Although the coding bootcamp I took part in involved around both front-end
and back-end, I'm way more experienced in the back-end; but that's not an
excuse to not teach yourself about front-end technologies! (I've done some 
basic React tutorials and built some small apps). The ecosystem in which I'm
more comfortable with is the ***JVM***. Lately I find myself digging more into
***Kotlin*** as I believe that, because it offers multiple coding paradigms, 
you can be more flexible when it comes to implementing a solution.

Aside from software development; I enjoy taking pictures with a trusty
point-and-shoot ***fujifilm*** camera; some other times I might pick up
my heavier ***Canon*** camera to shoot some short videos, which I edit
on various of software; I love sailing when I find the time; oh, and I used
to play the drums for about 7 years, but it's been a long time that last time
I played.

That's me :smile:
